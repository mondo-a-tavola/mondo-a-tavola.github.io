								</header>
								<p><i>Improve integration. Create contact. Humanize migrants.</i></p>
								<h3>The project</h3>
		<p>In our town Cesena (Emilia-Romagna, Italy) we organize intercultural dinners and events in public spaces. </br>
			Migrants and locals bring food and eat together. </br>
			During those events we collect recipes and let people tell their stories. </br>
			We upload the recipe connected to the story of the chef plus everything else he/she wants to share on this website.</p>
								<a href="#" class="image main"><img src="{{ "/images/pic01.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></a>
								
								<h3>Our motivation</h3>
		<p>There is a lot of discussion going on about migrants in European media and politics.</br>
              	But instead of raising awareness for the problems migrants are facing in their home countries, stereotypes and generalizations of migrants become stronger.</br>
		We started this project to focus on the individuals behind the process, their stories, views, motivations, beliefs.</br>
		Our aim is to foster multicategorization and contact between locals and migrants in Europe.</p>
								
								<h3>Not only us</h3>
		<p>This project is part of the bigger Erasmus+ project "Peacemakers" led by Koc University and other European Universities (Universidade Aberta, University of Bologna, Erasmus University Rotterdam, Gaziantep University and Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin). </br>
		Groups of students from every University meet around every six months for a bootcamp where we discuss issues connected to migration, visit local NGOs that work to improve integration
		and listen to lectures from experts of different fields connected to the topic. </br>
		Back home every group will implement its own local project that they made up in cooperation with local organisations already working in the field. </br>
		This is the project created and organised by us, the students group from University of Bologna, Italy (Campus of Cesena). Us, that means Adele, Chiara, Laura, Leonardo and Pier,
		five Psychology students from Cesena. The aim of our, but also of all the other local projects organised by our Turkish, German and Dutch friends, is to foster a more peaceful generation in Europe and in Turkey that approaches migrants with positive attitudes. </br>
